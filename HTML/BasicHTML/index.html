    <h1>Basic HTML Course</h1>
      <p>Below are links to the pages created while working through the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" targe="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> curriculum. I completed the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a> course in August 2024. I am currently working on the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/" targe="_blank">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</a> course, but it is a quite challanging.</p>
      <p>The Brains at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> are currently reworking their curriculum, so I am working through the new curriculum, too. I am in love with the new structure, and can't wait to complete the entire course!</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href="cat-photos.html" target="_blank">Cat Photos Page</a> is the first project in the HTML course. 2025.04.04</li>
        <li><a href="recipe-page.html" target="_blank">Recipe Page</a> was the 2nd lab project. 2025.04.04</li>
        <li><a href="travel-agency-page.html" target="_blank">Travel Agency Page</a> is the 3rd lab project, using figures & captions. 2025.04.07</li>
        <li><a href="video-compilation.html" target="_blank">Video Compilation Page</a> practices using the iframe element. 2025.04.07</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>After completing the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">Basic HTML</a> course, I worked on the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">Semantic HTML</a> course.</p>
    <p>I've documented my work <a href="../SemanticHTML/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. This is a total revamp of the Responsive Web Design curriculum. There are a lot more projects and details that weren't in the previous course. I'm very excited about working through and completing the <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer" target="_blank">Certified Full-Stack Develop Curriculum</a>.</p>
